With my new job starting in October, I have a four-month window to dedicate to personal and professional development. To make the most of this time, get in the habit of a full-time role and set myself up for success, I've created a structured plan focusing on:

1.  **Direct Career Enhancement:** Skills and knowledge that will directly contribute to my success in my upcoming role and long-term career.
2.  **Personal Growth (as a Muslim):** Activities and learning that will support my personal development.
3.  **Indirect Career Benefits:** Broader knowledge and skills that will indirectly support my professional journey.
4.  **Enjoyable Pursuits:** Hobbies and interests I want to dedicate time to before my schedule becomes more demanding.
