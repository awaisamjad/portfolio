I bought a server from Hetzner and a domain from Name.com. I updated the DNS records to point to my server's IP.

I use astro as my framework

To generate the HTML, CSS and JS files run:  
```bash
pnpm build
```
This generates a ./dist folder with the files.

To upload the site, I use rsync to sync only the changed files. Example:
```bash
rsync -azP --delete ./dist/ username@255.255.255.255:/home/username/website
```
I originally used nginx as my HTTP server, but now I use [Volk](/projects/volk), a server I built myself. It's basic but functional, and I plan to improve it over time.

Nginx is still running, but only as a reverse proxy. Volk runs on port 6543, while nginx listens on port 80 and forwards incoming traffic to Volk. This avoids having to reconfigure Volk for port 80.

I also want to build my own site generator or JS framework and rebuild the site using that, and maybe even use a home server to host it.
